README, written Wed 10 Jan 24 by George William James.

This is a live document that will be updated overtime, along with the project. The website will eventually be hosted properly, so please treat this as 
a proof of concept / test bed for new features.

Adding stuff to Hawkear.

This is a case of grabbing the folders that are spat out by Hawkear on the Ringers laptop.

File path should look something like the following:

  Hawkear
    Analyses
      SMLT + %Date% + %LengthOfPiece% + %PerformanceNumber%

To make these accessible on the website, grab the whole folder (should contain a series of files which add up to 49 files!) and store them inside the Hawkear folder.

*** Please note: GitHub will only allow you to add 100 files max if using the webpage. You may need to upload in pairs.

Next, you'll need to find the index.html under the Hawkear folder and copy the <div></div> blocks. These should contain the appropriate content. 
You may need to rename the content based on the analyses output. Links should include the .html file within the correct output file. 
If unsure, upload the output file and contact the Webmaster.
