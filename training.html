            <h2>A bit of history</h2>
            <p>
                The significance of St. Mary-le-Tower’s architectural heritage requires no explanation, however its place in the 
                development of the quintessentially English art of Change Ringing is significant. <br/>
                The bells of St. Mary-le-Tower are 
                amongst the best known in Britain and there was a time, particularly between the wars, when the St. Mary-le-Tower 
                Society of Change Ringers was the most accomplished company in the land with their achievements including the first 
                peals in the following methods:

            <h2>Our plan</h2>
            <p>
                Whilst we cannot reproduce such ground-breaking performances as our forebears, we are seeking to leave our own legacy in a different manner by bringing the art and science of Bellringing, and its place in the life of the Church, to the largest possible audience.  Our vision is to enhance the teaching of Bellringing not only at St. Mary-le-Tower and the rest of Ipswich but also throughout the rest of Suffolk and surrounding area whilst maintaining the best possible environment for ringing excellence.
                One important feature of our project is that there will be nothing to change the character of our bells.  Their tone and character is an important part of our heritage and will remain unaltered.
            </p>
            <p>    
                Our vision is to create a facility by installing a peal of 6 training bells immediately above the ceiling of the ringing chamber.  These training bells, linked to computer audio facilities, would be used to teach every aspect of ringing from the first lessons of bell-handling to the early stages of change ringing.  These training bells would be available to offer top quality opportunities for the teaching of our art to both our own recruits and any other groups who would wish to benefit from use of them.  They will also provide a facility for more able ringers to practice with no external sound, either as a band using the bells as a ring of 6, or using each of the six bells individually with its own dedicated simulator.<br />
            </p>
            <p>   
                The project will create a facility which will see St. Mary-le-Tower once again at the heart of ringing development.  It is widely acknowledged through the standardisation of ringing teaching techniques that a more modern approach needs to be taken to the teaching of ringing, particularly to bring an ancient art to a younger audience to enable its continuation and development.  Evidence from the Mancroft Ringing Discovery Centre in Norwich demonstrates that such a facility is particularly successful in engaging with young people in bringing them to ringing and subsequently other aspects of wider church life.      
            </p>
            <h2>The Present Position</h2>
            <p>
                Following meetings with our own ringers and the SMLT PCC we now have a firm quote for the installation of 6 training bells by Matthew Higby & Co and have also obtained the necessary Faculty from the Diocese to enable the project to proceed.  This leads us to the question of funding - we  are about a third of the way to our target but still need to raise a  further £20,000. Work is scheduled to commence in the second  half of 2024.
            </p>
            <h2>Funding</h2>
            <p>
                We are exploring multiple sources of funding but initially we are seeking people and organizations who would be willing to either loan or gift money to the project to meet our immediate cash flow requirements.
