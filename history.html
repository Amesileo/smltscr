            <h1>The History of Change Ringing</h1>
            <hr/>
            <h2>The History of Change Ringing</h2>
            <p>
                Change ringing, the traditional English method of sounding bells swinging 
                ‘full circle’, evolved during the 17th century. Each bell is swung a full 
                360 degrees and then back again. The basis of the art is that having 
                started from ’rounds’ (ringing down the scale), each bell follows a 
                pre-determined path amongst the others, so that the bells ring in a 
                different order each time until they return again to rounds. Fully 
                developed, this becomes an intricate and exacting science which today is 
                keenly pursued by over forty thousand men and women of all ages. They form 
                a well organised and important part of the Church and social life of 
                England and indeed many other countries where campanology has taken root. 
                In recent years English style change ringing bells have been installed for 
                the very first time in countries such as France, Belgium and Singapore.
            </p>
            <h2>Our Bells</h2>
            <p>
                There were only five bells and a Sanctus bell present in the tower in 1553. 
                The treble and tenor were then recast by Miles I Graye of Colchester in 1607 
                and 1610 respectively. In 1671 John Darbie of Ipswich recast the 2nd and 
                4th bells and added a treble to make a ring of six. The addition of two 
                trebles cast by Christopher Hodson in 1688 made this ring the third octave 
                in Suffolk. St. Mary-le-Tower’s octave was preceded by Horham in 1673 
                (the oldest surviving octave) and Hadleigh in circa 1680. They were then 
                followed by Framlingham and Bungay in 1718. The tenor of the octave at 
                St. Mary-le-Tower was approximately 24cwt. The first full peal recorded on 
                the bells was 5040 changes of Grandsire Triples on 12th December 1735. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1812 two trebles were added to the octave to make a ring of ten. The 
                newly augmented ring of bells was opened on Tuesday 7th of July 1812, being
                 the first day of the Ipswich races. These new trebles were provided and 
                 hung by John Naunton, a local bell hanger and ringer. They were cast by 
                 Thomas Mears. Alas the new trebles only lasted 32 years before being 
                 recast by John Taylor & Son in 1844/5. Only one peal was rung on this ring
                  of ten – Kent Treble Bob Royal on 16th February 1850 - before the great 
                  Victorian rebuilding where the tower and practically the whole church was
                   demolished and rebuilt. The rebuild took place in phases beginning with 
                   the chancel in 1850. In 1866/67 the restoration work was completed and 
                   following an interesting set of circumstances, see Colin Salter’s 
                   <a href="">history</a> of the St. Mary-le-Tower Society, the bells were 
                   made up to twelve by the addition of a new treble and tenor cast by John 
                   Warner & Sons. The 5th and the 9th (the old 4th and 8th of the ten) were 
                   also recast to correct the tuning. The new tenor weighed 301/2 cwt and was 
                   tuned to C#.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the 1866/67 restoration not much work done to the bells themselves until 
                the seventh cracked and was subsequently recast by Mears and Stainbank in 
                1946. In 1976 a full scale restoration took place with the recasting of 
                eight of the bells by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough including a fine new 
                tenor tuned to Db and weighing 34cwt. The remainder of the bells were 
                retuned and rehung with all new fittings. A sharp 2nd bell cast by John 
                Taylor & Co was added in 1980 to provide a lighter diatonic ring of eight 
                in Ab using the 8th as a tenor.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1999 following the generous bequest by Dr Ronald Jones the 5th was recast 
                and the 8th retuned. Bells 9, 10 and 11 were replaced with bells cast to a 
                heavier weight. The old 9th went to Australia to form the tenor of a ring of 
                8 in the key of F#. The old 10th is hung dead in the tower as the ‘passing’ 
                bell and the old 11th is also hung dead in the tower but as the ‘Sanctus’ bell. 
                Like the 1976 restoration, this work was also carried out by John Taylor & Co.
